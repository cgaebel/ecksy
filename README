STOP.

Before you do anything, make sure to run:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

to check out all submodules.

Ecksy has a few subdirectories of interest in here.

1) libtorrent
      This is a trunk version of libtorrent. I update it semi-regularly. Make
      sure to configure and install this before moving on to libtorrent-c.

      $ cd libtorrent
      $ bjam -j4 boost=system boost-link=shared dht-support=on geoip=off upnp-logging=off link=shared variant=release invariant-checks=on debug-symbols=off
      $ sudo bjam install

      If you don't already have it in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, add /usr/local/lib.
      This will ensure our libraries get picked up by the dynamic linker.

      $ echo 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib' >> ~/.bashrc

2) libtorrent-c
      The C bindings to the parts of libtorrent we need. After installing
      libtorrent-trunk, use CMake to build and install this DSO. It will be
      dynamically linked into the Ecksy executable.

      $ cd libtorrent-c
      $ mkdir build
      $ cd build
      $ cmake ..
      $ sudo make install

3) ecksy
      This is the actual webserver we will use to serve the torrents. It's
      based off of Yesod, and uses libtorrent-c to do the interfacing with
      libtorrent, which, in turn, does all the heavy lifting.

      $ cd ecksy
      $ cabal install yesod
      $ yesod --dev devel # Starts the debug server. Should need no setup.

      Then, every time you make a change to the project, just run:

      $ yesod --dev devel

      from within the ecksy directory.
