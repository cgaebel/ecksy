We have a few subdirectories of interest in here.

1) libtorrent
      This is a trunk version of libtorrent. I update it semi-regularly. Make
      sure to configure and install this before moving on to libtorrent-c

2) libtorrent-c
      The C bindings to the parts of libtorrent we need. After installing
      libtorrent-trunk, use CMake to build this DSO. It will be dynamically
      linked into the Ecksy executable.

3) ecksy
      This is the actual webserver we will use to serve the torrents. It's
      based off of Yesod, and uses libtorrent-c to do the interfacing with
      libtorrent, which, in turn, does all the heavy lifting.
